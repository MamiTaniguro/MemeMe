# MemeMe
An iOS app made with UIKit. This app enables a user take a photo or choose one from his/her library, then add text to the top and bottom to create a meme. The user also can share it on Facebook, Twitter, or by SMS. The app toggles from a table view to a collection view of already sent memes.
